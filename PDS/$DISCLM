Sam,

I finally got a statement from a government official that TPL
is in the public domain!

Mr. Opfermann-

    While it is true that the mainframe version of TPL is in     <<<<
the public domain, as mentioned earlier, BLS does not maintain   <<<<
or support the product.  This means that the agency cannot
issue additional copies of the product, and it cannot guarantee
reliable performance of the mainframe version, especially with
regard to Y2K compliancy.

    Therefore, we do encourage users who are interested in
the product for current applications to contact QQQ Software
to obtain the latest Windows/NT or Unix versions.

    If I can be of any further assistance, please do not
hesitate to contact me again.

Mr Bergman,

I found a very old (around 1985) manual for TPL which stated
that the user guide for TPL Version 6 was in the public domain.
Version 6, released in 1984, was the last mainframe release of
which I am aware.  I have not been able to determine if the
mainframe software is in the public domain.   Do you know if it
is in the public domain or who I can contact within the
government to determine if it is?

Thank you,

Dennis Opfermann

 Mr. Opfermann-

       Although development of the mainframe Table Producing
 Language (TPL) system originated at the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics in the early 1970's, TPL for IBM 360/370 computers
 is no longer available. BLS discontinued sales and support of
 this product about 15 years ago. BLS discontinued its own use a
 while ago because the mainframe version never became completely
 Y2K compliant; the relative time feature was known to have Y2K
 problems. Some organizations may still run the mainframe
 product, but BLS does not provide support.

       The company that produces and maintains TPL software
 products is called QQQ Software, Inc, and if you'd like more to
 obtain any more information, please go to their website at
 http://www.qqqsoftware.com/.

       Otherwise, if I could of any further assistance, please
 do not hesitate to call.

   I am searching for information on TPL for an IBM/360 or
   /370 mainframe.  I work as a contractor for the National
   Science Foundation.  NSF has TPL on their IBM mainframe
   which is scheduled to go out of service in early 2001.

   My understanding is that this software was produced by BLS
   and is now public domain software.  Can you provide me with
   a contact at BLS who could verify if this is true and help
   me obtain the software?
