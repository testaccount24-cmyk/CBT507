Sam,

QQQ is former BLS employees.  Sounds like BLS is trying to swing
things to QQQ.  Doesn't seems ethical to me.  I realized all along
that the QQQ BLS connection was the problem.

What I'm trying to do is get TPL running on Hercules as an interim
solution until about 300 programs are rewritten, probably in a SAS
PROC TABULATE.  It's unlikely that this interim solution will be
ever be used, but the project manager wants to know that the option
is available.  I guess it probably will be used as a verification
platform for the rewritten programs.  I've written Jay Maynard about
this use of Hercules and he's blessed it appropriately.

So, my boss wants to be able to give back to the Hercules
community.  I've had his support in getting this statement (tho
it's been on my time, not company time) and I'll keep trying,
again on my own time, to get a manual.  I've also mirrored some
files for Wolfgang Schaefer's binary distribution.

Many folks in the group have been helpful to me and I'm planning
to say involved with the Hercules group as a hobby (my wife says I
don't need any more hobbies).  I've been developing systems for

Anyway, I'll keep trying on the manual - I'd like one myself.  I
have access to the mainframe at the National Science Foundation
(until it goes off-line on March 31), but they don't have a good
copy of TPL.V6.MANUAL - their copy had no members.  :-(

My wife works at EPA.  I'll ask her to try the EPA data center for
an electronic copy of the manual.  (Contracting to EPA was my first
*real* mainframe programming job).  Now, armed with the statement
that says TPL is in the public domain she has a better chance of
success!!

I was able to execute some of the TPL catalog procedures over
the weekend.  I've broken out the steps and run each one and
I've verified the executables and object libraries work under
Hercules/MVS3.8J.

My only problem is the sort.  I don't have sort on my system.
Any ideas on this topic?

hoping it doesn't take another 4 months to find a manual,
Dennis
