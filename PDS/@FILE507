//***FILE 507 is from Dennis Opfermann and contains TPL V6.0 for    *   FILE 507
//*           MVS which was developed at the Bureau of Labor        *   FILE 507
//*           Statistics (BLS) and which is now in the public       *   FILE 507
//*           domain.  There is a TPL vendor product for other      *   FILE 507
//*           platforms, but the original TPL for MVS is public.    *   FILE 507
//*                                                                 *   FILE 507
//*           TPL or Table Producing Language, was one of the       *   FILE 507
//*           first facilities for tabulating statistical data,     *   FILE 507
//*           and was in wide use at a considerable number of       *   FILE 507
//*           Federal government agencies until recently.           *   FILE 507
//*                                                                 *   FILE 507
//*           Rumor has it, that TPL was used as the basis for      *   FILE 507
//*           the code in SAS "PROC TABULATE".  (Unsubstantiated    *   FILE 507
//*           until substantiated.)                                 *   FILE 507
//*                                                                 *   FILE 507
//*           TPL is currently being shipped without the manual,    *   FILE 507
//*           until we find a copy.                                 *   FILE 507
//*                                                                 *   FILE 507
